# SAS Programming for Public Health Analytics

*By Aly Drame, MD, MPH, MBA.* A structured SAS programming curriculum applied to public-health data, from environment setup through reporting and visualization. Datasets are synthetic or built-in SAS library data (Emory AEPI537D course material) — no real patient or program records.

## Overview

This repository presents a structured SAS programming curriculum applied to public health datasets. Topics are organized to follow the **natural data analysis workflow** — from environment setup and raw data import through transformation, analysis, reporting, automation, and visualization.

The course material originates from AEPI537D (Introduction to SAS Programming) at the Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University. All datasets are either synthetic or built-in SAS library datasets.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open each `.sas` script in SAS 9.4 (or SAS Studio).
3. At the top of each script, update the `libname phdata` path to point to the `/data` folder in this repository:
   ```sas
   libname phdata 'C:\Users\YourName\sas-public-health-analytics\data';
   ```
4. Run scripts in phase order (01 → 12) for the complete workflow.

## Public Health Context

Public health data analysis frequently involves messy, multi-source datasets — survey records, clinical extracts, administrative files, and surveillance reports. The skills in this repository address the full pipeline a public health analyst encounters:

- Importing heterogeneous data formats (text, Excel, proprietary)
- Merging datasets from different collection arms (clinical + demographic + lab)
- Creating analysis-ready variables (age groups, exposure windows, date intervals)
- Handling longitudinal data with multiple encounters per subject
- Producing clean, labeled output for reports and publications
- Automating repetitive tasks with macros
- Visualizing geographic and distributional patterns
